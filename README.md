 # 🌐 CIVIKA – A Sovereign Social Superapp for the Ethical Digital Age

> **“Not another social network. A new civilizational layer for human dignity in the digital era.”**

CIVIKA is a next-generation, **ethically-driven, decentralized superapp** designed to unify social interaction, creative expression, community governance, financial sovereignty, and therapeutic presence—all within a single, coherent, and human-centered ecosystem.

Built from the ground up with **privacy, autonomy, and healing as core principles**, CIVIKA isn’t just an alternative to TikTok, Instagram, or Twitter.  
**It’s the infrastructure for a post-algorithmic, post-exploitative digital society.**

## 🌱 Vision

CIVIKA emerges from a deep critique of the current attention economy, where trauma is monetized, intimacy is simulated, and human dignity is traded for engagement.

We believe:
- **Technology should serve humanity—not extract from it.**
- **The self is not a product to be optimized—but a sovereign entity to be honored.**
- **True community is built on consent, not virality.**
- **Healing is not a side effect of connection—it is its purpose.**

## 🔑 Core Features

CIVIKA integrates 11 interwoven modules into a seamless experience:

### 1. **Unified Timeline with Hybrid Algorithm**  
A single feed that harmonizes text, audio, video, code, events, polls, and documents.  
→ **No addictive infinite scroll.**  
→ **No engagement-driven ranking.**  
→ **User-defined intent filters**: *“Show me healing today”*, *“Only art from Quilmes”*, *“No politics this week.”*

### 2. **Multi-Format Post System**  
Create in the medium that fits your soul:  
- 🎵 **Audio Posts** (loops, songs, spoken word)  
- 🎥 **Video Live** (with debate rooms)  
- 💻 **Code Posts** (snippets with syntax highlighting)  
- 📄 **Document Posts** (PDFs, essays, manifestos)  
- 🗓️ **Event Posts** (with RSVP & calendar sync)  
- 📊 **Poll Posts** (community voting)  

> Your mind isn’t one-dimensional. Why should your expression be?

### 3. **Community & Forums**  
Self-governing micro-societies with:  
- Role-based moderation (admin, mod, member)  
- Thematic channels (#music, #technology, #art)  
- Voting, pinned posts, event calendars  
- **Ethical by design**: no anonymous hate, no unmoderated chaos

### 4. **Integrated Chat**  
Secure, intimate, and sovereign:  
- Ephemeral messages (self-destructing)  
- Reactions, replies, group chats  
- Bots for utility (not surveillance)  
- **Zero metadata retention**

### 5. **Live Streaming with Debate Rooms**  
Go live not for clout—but for connection:  
- Co-hosts (collaborative broadcasting)  
- **Sub-rooms for real-time debate** (e.g., “Room A: Policy”, “Room B: Ethics”)  
- Chat moderation by community vote  

> Transform audiences into assemblies.

### 6. **Creator Profile as Existential Archive**  
Your profile is not a brand—it’s your legacy:  
- Biographical narrative (not just a bio)  
- Featured works (not just the latest post)  
- Specialized feeds: *Loops*, *Debates*, *Code*  
- **Ethical Badges**

### 7. **Just Monetization Engine**  
Get paid fairly, instantly, and fully:  
- 💎 **Subscriptions** (tiered, no platform cut)  
- 💸 **Donations in USDC** (global, instant, feeless)  
- 🛍️ **Creator Store** (merch, digital goods, NFTs)  
- 🌱 **Community Rewards** (for participation, not performance)

> You keep 100% of your value. Always.

### 8. **Fediverse Interoperability** (ActivityPub)  
CIVIKA is not an island. It’s a **node in a global ethical network**:  
- Follow Mastodon, Pixelfed, PeerTube users directly  
- Broadcast your posts across the Fediverse  

> Your voice travels with you—no platform lock-in.

### 9. **Ethical AI Moderation**  
AI as guardian, not judge:  
- Detects harassment, hate speech, and self-harm cues  
- Applies **shadowban** (reduces visibility without humiliation)  
- Never censors—only **protects**  
- **No data leaves your device** (local LLMs via Ollama integration)

### 10. **Universal Basic Income** (UBI) in USDC  
A radical economic model for digital dignity:  
- **Monthly Fixed UBI**: Adjusted to local cost of life (e.g., Quilmes vs. Tokyo)  
- **Daily Creation Bonus**: Earn USDC for ethical participation  
- **Fully automated, transparent, and auditable**  

> Everyone deserves to exist. CIVIKA ensures they can.

### 11. **Digital Parliament**  
Govern CIVIKA with your voice:  
- **Three Chambers**: Proposals → Deliberation → Voting  
- **Ethical Voting Weight**: Based on contribution quality, not follower count  
- Debates on features, ethics, community rules  
- **Transparency**: All decisions archived on IPFS  

> Not democracy by likes. Democracy by wisdom.

## 💡 Why CIVIKA Matters

In a world where:
- Social media **sells your attention**,  
- Algorithms **amplify trauma**,  
- Platforms **own your identity**,  
- And “community” is just a metric…  

**CIVIKA offers a different path**:  
→ A space where you are **not a user—but a citizen**.  
→ Where your art **is not content—but medicine**.  
→ Where your voice **is not data—but dignity**.

This isn’t utopia.  
**It’s necessity.**
